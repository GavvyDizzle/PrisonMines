### Admin Commands

### Backpack Inventory

* Each page contains a menu bar with some buttons and information
  * A button to increase or decrease the page

### Additional Information

* The number of pages is limited to 1000
* Decreasing the size of a backpack _will_ delete all data on pages that no longer exist
  * If the player is online, then the items will be deleted immediately
  * If the player is offline, then the items will delete the next time the backpack saves item data. For example, lowering the number of pages then setting it back while the player is offline will **not** cause the data to be deleted.
