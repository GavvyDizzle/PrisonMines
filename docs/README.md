## Disclaimer

Not all of my plugins are open sourced. Some of my plugins are open source while others have been created/modified for specific servers. The documentation will still exist for these projects, so this site can remain a hub for all documentation. If you are interested in any of my private plugins reach out to me on discord (GavvyDizzle).

## My Favorite Plugins

* PrisonEnchants - A \*huge\* custom enchantment plugin. I have spent a few hundred hours making over 150 custom enchants and many custom systems inside of it. Extremely efficient
* PlayerIslands - A custom plots/cells/skyblock base which allows for generation of user specific areas. Integrates with WorldGuard for protections. The custom grouping generation scheme is one of a kind!
* RewardsInventory - Coming from JailBreakMC, I found the /rew system to be poorly designed. I designed a 2 part system which supports the prison landscape much better. Recent updates to this plugin have made it much more performant and admin-friendly
