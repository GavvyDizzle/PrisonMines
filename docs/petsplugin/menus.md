# Menus

## Pet Selection Menu

Where players store their active pets

* Define slot(s) where players can place pets
* Define permissions to go with these slots to only unlock a certain number of slots
* The position of stored pets persists
* Also contains item(s) which allow players to update message settings

### Admin Editing

Admins are able to access a player's selection menu and modify its contents

* **Supports offline player editing**
* Due to concurrency issues, only one player can edit the pets at a time. This is determined by the player who opened the menu earlier
* Right-clicking allows you to bypass the pet cooldown
* Editing the menu of an online player will push any potion effect changes to the player

## Pet Menu System

Now the fun stuff! You are able to define menus which contain the pets you have created

### Item Types

Four item types are supported. Check out the example file for proper syntax

* `BACK` A simple item that brings the player back to the main menu when clicked (unable to be put in the main menu)
* `ITEM` Contains text. Does nothing when clicked
* `LINK` Define an item that opens another menu when clicked
* `PET` Places the pet's "menu item" in this location

### Menus Explained

* The main menu is always opened first when running the menu open command. Back buttons always go back to this menu
* You are able to define submenus that are accessible via `LINK` items
* This menu system lends itself to organization, so keep it organized for your players
