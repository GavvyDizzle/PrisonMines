# misc

* When put into the `/pets` menu, the pet item is not saved. The pet is "regenerated" every time the menu is opened and when the pet is removed from the menu
  * Any changes made to a pet's name and lore will be deleted once a pet enters the menu
  * Stacked pets are not supported. Equipping a stacked pet will cause all but one to be deleted immediately!
