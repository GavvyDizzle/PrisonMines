# Pets

## Creation

The example pet (in the example\_configs folder) should contain all the reference information needed to create a new pet

* Each pet is created by defining a new `.yml` file in the `PetsPlugin/pets` directory
* All sub-folders in this directory are also parsed

## Levels

* Each pet has its own leveling system. This can be duplicated across all pets, or differ between them. It is up to you!
* You can specify the min/max level of the pet
  * Making the min/max the same will not allow the pet to level up
* The `amounts` section requires you to define `maxLevel - minLevel` values. These determine how much xp each level takes to complete
  * If you do not specify enough levels, a warning will print in the console

### Earning Experience

Experience is needed for pets to level up. Equipped pets earn experience from different events

* You can define different ways for players to obtain XP in `xp.yml`
  * Setting `useGlobalForAllPets` to true will override any entries in individual pet files
* For each pet, you use the `xp` section to define what that pet subscribes to
  * If multiple selected pets subscribe to the same entry, then the XP will be shared evenly
  * Once at max level, pets no longer earn XP so their share is redistributed among the remaining pets (if any)
* The following experience types have their own WorldGuard flag which must be set:
  * `MINING` - `flag: pets-mining-xp` - Earn XP by mining blocks
  * `KILLING` - `flag: pets-killing-xp` - Earn XP by killing entities

## Boosts

There are 6 types of boosts available. A pet can have an unlimited number of boosts attached to it

* `DAMAGE` Multiply damage dealt to all entities or the type(s) you specify
* `DOUBLE_REWARD` A percent chance to give 2 rewards instead of 1 (MineRewards _private_)
* `GENERAL_REWARD` Increase the chance to find rewards (MineRewards _private_)
* `ENCHANT` Increase activation chance of all or specified enchants (PrisonEnchants _private_)
* `POTION_EFFECT` Apply an infinite potion effect
* `XP` Increase experience earned (PlayerLevels _private_)
* All boosts apart from `POTION_EFFECT` accept an equation to determine the boost amount. The variable `x` is replaced with the pet's level

## Rewards

Each pet has its own reward system. This allows an equipped pet to run commands when different events happen

* The `rewardChance` field is the chance to give out a reward when requirements are met. This value must be between 0 and 1 \[0,1]
* The following reward types have their own WorldGuard flag which must be set:
  * `MINING` - `flag: pets-mining-rewards` - Give a reward when breaking blocks
  * `KILLING` - `flag: pets-killing-rewards` - Give a reward when killing entities
* When giving a reward, the plugin will send any `messages` before sending the `commands`

## Pet Item

This is the item that players will receive in-game when interacting with this pet

* This section parses special placeholders. These are only usable in the lore of the item except for `{lvl}`
  * `{lvl}` The current level
  * `{next_lvl_xp}` The total experience needed to reach the next level
  * `{xp}` How much experience the pet has gathered since reaching this level
  * `{xp_remaining}` The amount of experience still needed to reach the next level
  * `{percent}` The percent of the way to the next level (2 decimal places max)
  * `{boost_x}` Gets the boost amount for boost ID `x` at the pet's current level

## Menu Item

Each pet has a special section, which is used when the pet is displayed in a menu (this is different from the pet item players can obtain).

* This section parses special placeholders. These are only usable in the lore of the item
  * `{max_level}` The max level of the pet
  * `{boost_x_y}` Gets the boost amount for boost ID `x` at level `y`
